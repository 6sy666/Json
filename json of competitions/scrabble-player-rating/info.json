    "data_intro": "Predict players' ratings based on Woogles.io gameplay. The dataset includes information about ~73,000 Scrabble games played by three bots on Woogles.io: BetterBot (beginner), STEEBot (intermediate), and HastyBot (advanced). The games are between the bots and their opponents who are regular registered users. You are using metadata about the games as well as turns in each game (i.e., players' racks and where and what they played, AKA gameplay) to predict the rating of the human opponents in the test set (test.csv). You will train your model on gameplay data from one set of human opponents to make predictions about a different set of human opponents in the test set.",
