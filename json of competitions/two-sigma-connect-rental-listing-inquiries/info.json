    "data_intro": "How much interest will a new rental listing on RentHop receive? Two Sigma invites you to apply your talents in this recruiting competition featuring rental listing data from RentHop. Kagglers will predict the number of inquiries a new listing receives based on the listingâ€™s creation date and other features. Doing so will help RentHop better handle fraud control, identify potential listing quality issues, and allow owners and agents to better understand renters' needs and preferences. In this competition, you will predict how popular an apartment rental listing is based on the listing content like text description, photos, number of bedrooms, price, etc. The data comes from renthop.com, an apartment listing website. These apartments are located in New York City. The target variable, interest_level, is defined by the number of inquiries a listing has in the duration that the listing was live on the site.",
