    "data_intro": "Predict how sales of weather-sensitive products are affected by snow and rain. You have been provided with sales data for 111 products whose sales may be affected by the weather (such as milk, bread, umbrellas, etc.). These 111 products are sold in stores at 45 different Walmart locations. Some of the products may be a similar item (such as milk) but have a different id in different stores/regions/suppliers. The 45 locations are covered by 20 weather stations (i.e. some of the stores are nearby and share a weather station). The competition task is to predict the amount of each product sold around the time of major weather events. For the purposes of this competition, we have defined a weather event as any day in which more than an inch of rain or two inches of snow was observed. You are asked to predict the units sold for a window of Â±3 days surrounding each storm. You are provided with the full observed weather covering the entire data set. You do not need to forecast weather in addition to sales (it's as though you have a perfect weather forecast at your disposal).",
